### 1. Resources for Students 

In this space you will be able to download the [Thesis-Latex Template](LaTeX-Thesis-Template.zip). Thanks to my former colleague Dr. Daniel C Doolan for putting it together. The use of latex is optional, but I highly recommend it. It helps you create structured report, and enables you to handle and manage bibliographies much easier. 


Notice that in order to be able to use latex, you have two options: 1.	Install [Latex]( https://www.latex-project.org/) locally on your machine and also you need a Latex Editor  such as [Tex Studio]( https://www.texstudio.org/) or similar editor 2.	An easier and alternative editor is use online editor such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), ### 2. Project Investigation

The investigation report for your MSc project is very important. I, therefore, highly recommend that you start writing from day one, don't leave this to the last minute. You will find the latex thesis template in this repository and I also highly recommend using it for producing your report. There are so many ways you can structure your report, but here is a recommended guideline. You can change this subject to the nature of your project: 

**Chapter 1**: This is the most critical part at this stage, I call this chapter the road map, and suggest you start working on this chapter. Chapter 1 is an introduction chapter, 5 to 7 pages at most, and should capture the whole story, it must be structured into sections and subsections and should set the scene for the rest of the report, and I recommend the following structure: 

a. Overview: Brief overview of the project,

b. Background: Brief background without technical depth on the problem. For example, if you are going to use Deep Learning so you might discuss it briefly with a few examples/ citations which show that it is state-of-the-art in some domains

c. Motivation: Why this project is important? 

d. Objectives: a list of objectives (bullet points), and need to be clear (i.e. 1. Carry out an extensive literature review, .... 2. Build an Experimental framework to do, ...)

e. Thesis structure: Often a brief section starts as follows: This report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 provides an in-depth critical review of relevant work. Chapter 3 ...**Chapter 2**: This is the most important part of your investigation report. You must review and critically discuss relevant literature. You will search and select the relevant peer-reviewed papers (journals, conferences), and cite them appropriately in this chapter. You should use some figures/ illustrations to explain the content if needed. Again, the chapter can be structured into sections and subsections, subject to the topic you are reviewing (e.g. Overview, Methods, Datasets, Challenges, ...)

**Remaining Chapters**: This Will be discussed in our weekly meeting
