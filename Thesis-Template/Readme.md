### 1. Resources for Students 

In this space you will be able to download the [Thesis-Latex Template](LaTeX-Thesis-Template.zip). Thanks to my former colleague Dr. Daniel C Doolan for putting it together. The use of latex is option, but I highly recommend it. It helps you create structured report, and enables you to handle and manage bibliographies much easier. 


Notice that in order to be able to use latex, you have two options: 1.	Install [Latex]( https://www.latex-project.org/) locally on your machine and also you need a Latex Editor  such as [Tex Studio]( https://www.texstudio.org/) or similar editor 2.	An easier and alternative editor is use online editor such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/),
